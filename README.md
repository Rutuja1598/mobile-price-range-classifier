Data Preprocessing :

Dataset Acquisition: Obtaining the relevant dataset for analysis.
Library Integration: Importing essential libraries to facilitate data manipulation and analysis.
Data Import: Loading the dataset into the analysis environment.
Missing Data Handling: Identifying and addressing any missing values in the dataset.
Categorical Data Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical format for machine learning compatibility.
Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: Performing necessary data cleaning and creating new features to enhance the dataset's quality and suitability for modeling.
In exploratory data analysis (EDA), I conducted the following key analyses:

Target Variable Distribution: Examined the balance of the target variable (mobile price range) to understand its distribution.

Battery Power Impact: Explored how battery power (mAh) is related to mobile prices and visualized its distribution.

Dual SIM and Wi-Fi Support: Determined the number of mobile devices supporting dual SIM and Wi-Fi functionality.

Support for 4G and 3G: Analyzed the impact of 4G and 3G support on mobile prices.

Screen Attributes and Price: Investigated whether RAM, screen height, and screen resolution influence mobile prices.

Resolution vs. Price Range: Compared screen resolution with price ranges to identify any trends.

Correlation Analysis: Plotted a heatmap to visualize the correlation between price range and other features in the dataset.

Pair Plot: Plotted Pair Plot to gain further insights by visualizing various feature combinations simultaneously.
